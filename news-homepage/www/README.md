## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

After looking over the design files, I know I'll be implementing **css grid** the acheive a layout similar to the _Holy Grail_ template. Beore I write any HTML or CSS, however, I want to break the desktop design down even further so I can better visualize how to structure my HTML.

![Design Outline](assets/images/design/desktop-design_outline.png)

There will be two primary containers, the `<header>` and `<main>` elements. The header will contain two children, an `<img>` and a `<nav>` which will contain a nested `<ul>` where the actual navigation links will reside.

The main container will nest three `<section>` elements: one for the main story, one for new stories, and another for top stories.

###### HTML Outline

```html
<header>...</header>

<main class="grid">
	<section>...</section>
	<section>...</section>
	<section>...</section>
</main>
```

### Mobile-First

Now that I have a general idea of how to acheive the desktop design, it's time to start writing the HTML. I'm taking a **mobile-first** approach which will allow me to focus solely on the content in the beginning, then I can slowly work my way up to desktop dimensions and eventually install the grid using **media queries**.

The nice thing about a barebones mobile-first design is that everything, for the most part, is already responsive with the exception of images.

###### Barebones Mobile-First CSS

```css
.main-article__img {
	width: 100%;
}
```

### Accessibility

Another focus of mine for this project is **accessibility**, which is why I'm using `<ul>` and `<ol>` elements to group information like navigation links and articles. My starting goal is to create a barebones, user-friendly and accessible page that is fully functional with as little CSS as possible (as shown below). Here's a [screenshot ](assets/images/design/phase01.png) of what I came up with.

### Styling the Menu

Now that I'm ready to implement the actual design of the page, I need to style my navigation links so they're floating on a pane that will eventually slide in and out of the viewport. Once I've got this down, I'll need to write some **JavaScript** to make my menu interactive. I'll also need to figure out how to dim the rest of the page when the navigation menu is open.
